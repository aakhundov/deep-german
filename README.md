This project is associated to the deep learning course. We are trying to build a model which can successfully learn to classify various German nouns into their gender-specific classes in the hopes
that it will provide us with some insights into the underlying pattern of how the rules for classfying them according to grammar are constructed. 

Architecture proposed : RNNs + LSTMs / CNNs (if time permits).
Tools proposed : Python2/3 + TensorFlow + Keras(?)
